## Materials Presets Management in Klippain-Chocolate

Klippain Chocolate's `START_PRINT` macro, is able to adjust printer behavior based on material presets.

> [!NOTE]
The following `_USER_VARIABLES` parameters are not used anymore and transfered to `gcode_macro _MATERIAL` array : 
`purge_length`,
`standby_retract_length`, `purge_speed`, `retract_length`, `unretract_length`, `prime_line_flowrate`,
`prime_line_pressure_length`

If existing, `material_parameters` is migrated into the material array in the save_variables file.



### Default Material Settings

The `gcode_macro _MATERIAL` contains default values for material variables:
```elixir
variable_default: { 

    "pressure_advance": 0.048,
    "pressure_advance_smooth_time": 0.015,
    "retract_length": 0.5,
    "unretract_extra_length": 0,
    "retract_speed": 40,
    "unretract_speed": 30,
    "filter_speed": 80,
    "additional_z_offset": 0,
    "filament_sensor": 1,

    "standby_retract_length": 20,       # Amount to retract after purge or endprint (in mm) to place filament in standby zone (Should be near the prime_pressure_lenght)

    "prime_line_pressure_length": 18,   # distance to push filament to add  pressure into hotend (value near standby_retract_length if you purge before print )
    "prime_line_purge_length": 30,      # length of filament to purge (in mm)
    "prime_line_flowrate": 10,          # mm3/s used for the prime line

    # DEPRECATED "purge_speed": 2.5,    # Speed to purge (in mm/s)
    
    "purge_flowrate": 6,                # flowrate to purge (in mm3/s)
    "purge_length": 30,                 # Amount to purge (in mm)

    }
```

### Managing Material Presets

Material references are passed from the slicer to the printer via the `start_gcode` (see [start_print.md](./start_print.md)). The material reference is retained across restarts to ensure consistent macros functionality. Use the following macros to manage material presets:

- `SET_MATERIAL`: Add or modify material parameters. If the `NAME` parameter is not provided, it will modify the current material. A prompt will ask if you want to retain the values across restarts. The new material will inherit default settings for any unspecified parameters.
- `REMOVE_MATERIAL`: Delete the material. If the `NAME` parameter is not provided, it will delete the current material. A prompt will ask if you want to permanently remove the material across restarts.
- `SELECT_MATERIAL`: Choose material settings from list. This macro is a UI helper and **MUST NOT** be used inside `START_PRINT`.
